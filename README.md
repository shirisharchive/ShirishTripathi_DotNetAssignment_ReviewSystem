This is academic project using Dotnet technology.Under the guidance of Er.Nabaraj Ghimire I have created a simple Laptop review system.

What I have done?

Created a mvc core project on visual studio Scaffolded indentity for the project Database Connection string updation adding this snippet in _Layout.cshtml For each components created a model under class For that respective model created a controller using MVC controller with views,using Entity framework. Hence, views are updated when controller is created. Since, model is responsible for communication with database so it must contain the columns name under the name of table in my case namespace Shirish_Tripathi_Dot_Net_Assignment. Models { public class Reviewer { public int Id { get; set; } // Primary Key public required string Name { get; set; } } } here reviewer is a table and it contains Id and Name of reviewer.

Here are the sample images of work done
